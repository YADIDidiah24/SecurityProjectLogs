# Identifying Security Threats Using Logs for Penetration Testing

This project focuses on using logs to enhance the security of a login system during penetration testing. Logs play a critical role in detecting security threats like unauthorized access, failed login attempts, and DoS attacks. By generating and analyzing system logs, the project identifies potential vulnerabilities and provides recommendations for securing the system against evolving cyber threats. Tools like Flask, Rsyslog, and Apache Benchmark were used to simulate and detect attacks, while scripts were developed to mitigate risks, such as blocking DoS attempts.

The project emphasizes the importance of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks in ensuring robust security measures. While the project successfully identified and mitigated several security risks, it also highlighted some limitations, such as complete server blockage during a DoS attack. Future recommendations include conducting more test scenarios, improving host/network security settings, and implementing regular security audits.
